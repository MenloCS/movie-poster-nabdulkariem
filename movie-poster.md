# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title:** the maze runner 
- **Why I chose this movie:** its my favorite movie

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:**  tension and wonder

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:**  a maze and thomas(the main charachter)
- **Why this element:**  its the cores of the movie

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):**  green/blue 
- **Accent color(s):**  black and grey and hints of yellow

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a movie poster of the Maze Runner that centers the mian charachter thomas in the center who looks famished and like he ran a marathon with him being the focal point. Make thomas look worried and hopeful at the same time. Have a maze in the back of the poster. Have the main colors be blue/green with accent colors and shading be in black with hints of yellow. 
- **What worked:** thomas apperance in the middle and the colors and theres a maze
- **What didn't work:**   everything except there is yellow things coming at him, and the maze is rounded with a big open space
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  talk more about the maze, but keep how i talked about thomas the same

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a movie poster of the maze runner that centers the main character thomas in the center who looks famished and like he ran a marathon with him being the focal point. Make thomas look worried and hopeful at the same time. Have a maze in the back of the poster. Make the maze be zoomed out in the back and very tight corners. Have the main colors be blue/green with accent colors and shading be in black with hints of yellow in the green and black dark places.

- **What worked:**  thomas is the same, the maze corners are tighter
- **What didn't work:**  the font for the mazerunner is bad, hes just on top of the maze. and the yellow are just vibrant colors in random places
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  ill talk about the text and where thomas position is

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")* 

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a movie poster of the maze runner that centers the main character thomas in the center who looks famished and like he ran a marathon with him being the focal point. Make thomas look worried and hopeful at the same time. Have thomas be in a maze with very tight corners. Make thomas running/jogging towards the camera in the tight corners. Have the main colors be blue/green with accent colors and shading be in black with hints of yellow. 

- **What worked:**  he was running very well, tight corners. the font is back to normal. the caption is good
- **What didn't work:**  he has yellow/green powers in his back
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  ill just take out the green/yellow highlights fully so then it doesnt mess up anything

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make a movie poster of the maze runner that centers the main character thomas in the center who looks famished and like he ran a marathon with him being the focal point. Make thomas look worried and hopeful at the same time. Have thomas be in a maze with very tight corners. Make thomas running/jogging towards the camera in the tight corners. Have the main colors be blue/green with accent colors and shading be in black.

- **What worked:**  It took out the yellow random add ins and thomas is the same
- **What didn't work:**  the maze looks funkier

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  i added in yellow highlights myself
2.  i added in "staring: dylan obrien"
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
